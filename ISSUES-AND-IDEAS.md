# Issues & Future Ideas - Aurora Ledger

## 🐛 Known Issues (To Fix)

### High Priority
- [x] **Dashboard forecast variable error** - Fixed ✅
  - Issue: Variable `forecast` was referenced but declared as `forecastData`
  - Location: `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx` line 286
  - Status: FIXED - Changed all `forecast` references to `forecastData`

- [x] **Admin User Details Modal** - Completed ✅
  - Feature: Click eye icon on users to view detailed information
  - Implementation:
    - Backend endpoint: `GET /api/admin/users/:id/details`
    - User Details Modal with 3 sections:
      1. Account Information (email, name, role, currency, registration method, joined date)
      2. Statistics (transaction/category/budget/goal/recurring counts)
      3. Family Memberships (families, roles, members with expandable lists)
    - Role badges with icons (Crown/Shield/UserCheck/Eye)
    - "This user" tag to highlight current user in member lists

  - Status: COMPLETE and committed ✅

- [x] **Family Invite Code Generation 404 Error** - Fixed ✅
  - Issue: Frontend POST to `/families/join` but backend expected `/join/:code` with code in URL params
  - Root Cause: Route mismatch - frontend sends code in request body, backend expected URL parameter
  - Location: `backend/routes/families.js` line 649
  - Solution: 
    - Changed route from `POST /join/:code` to `POST /join`
    - Updated to read `code` from `req.body` instead of `req.params`
    - Added validation: `if (!code) return 400`
  - Impact: Generate Invite Code modal now works correctly
  - Status: FIXED and committed ✅

    - Updated UI with clear placeholders: "0 = Unlimited", "0 = Never expires"
    - Added helpful hints with 💡 emoji
    - Backend already supported null values (unlimited)
    - Frontend now properly converts 0 or empty to null
  - UX Improvements:
    - Changed min from 1 to 0 on both inputs

    - viewMode state to switch between views
    - Conditional rendering for filters and lists
    - TransactionModal checkbox "Make Recurring" creates recurring + transaction
  - Dual Workflow:
    - Quick: Add Transaction modal → Tick "Make Recurring" checkbox
    - Full: Click "Add Recurring" button → Opens /recurring page with full form
    - View/Manage: Transactions > Recurring tab (toggle, delete)
  - Benefits:
    - All transactions in one place
    - Better UX - related features together
    - Flexible: Quick add via modal OR full form
    - Recurring tab hidden from sidebar (cleaner navigation)

  - Verification:
    - Analytics.jsx: NO Layout import, returns content directly
    - Family.jsx: NO Layout import, returns content directly
    - App.jsx: Uses Layout component properly via Outlet
  - Solution: Architecture is correct, issue no longer exists
  - Status: RESOLVED - No action needed ✅

### Medium Priority

  - Warning: `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` not set
  - Impact: Users cannot login with Google
  - Location: Backend `.env` file
  - Fix: Need to create Google OAuth app and add credentials

- [ ] **Port 5000 conflict on restart**
  - Issue: Backend sometimes fails to start because port is already in use
  - Solution: Kill existing process or use different port
  - Workaround: `Get-Process -Name node | Stop-Process -Force`

### Low Priority

## 📝 Notes

### Current Tech Stack
**Frontend:**
- React 18 + Vite (fast builds, HMR)
- React Query (5min cache, reduces API calls 80%)
- Tailwind CSS (utility-first styling)
- Recharts (data visualization)
- React Router v6 (nested routes with Layout/Outlet)
- i18next (10 languages supported)
- jsPDF (PDF export for reports)

**Backend:**
- Node.js v22 + Express
- PostgreSQL (20+ tables, Neon serverless)
- JWT authentication (30-day expiry, auto-cleanup)
- Bcrypt password hashing
- Passport.js (OAuth support)
- Node-cron (recurring transaction processor)
- Resend (email delivery, 100/day free)

**External APIs:**
- ExchangeRate-API (1,500 req/month free, 29 currencies)

**Hosting (100% FREE):**
- Frontend: Vercel (unlimited bandwidth, global CDN)
- Backend: Render (750 hrs/month, sleeps after 15min - use UptimeRobot)
- Database: Neon (0.5GB, pauses after 7 days inactivity)
- Monitoring: UptimeRobot (ping every 5min, prevents sleep)

### Architecture Decisions
- **React Router v6** with nested routes
- **Layout component** wraps all authenticated pages via `<Outlet />`
  - ⚠️ Do NOT remove Layout wrapper - causes blank screens
  - Always add empty state UI instead of removing Layout
- **Currency Context** provides global currency conversion
- **Theme Context** for dark/light mode persistence (localStorage)
- **Auth Context** manages user session and JWT token
- **API caching** with React Query (5min TTL, stale-while-revalidate)

### Database Schema (20+ Tables)
- **users** - Authentication, roles (admin/moderator/user), OAuth provider
- **families** - Group sharing, owner tracking
- **family_members** - Roles (owner/admin/member/viewer), join dates
- **transactions** - Income/expense with currency, category, notes
- **categories** - Custom categories with colors
- **budgets** - Monthly limits per category with currency
- **goals** - Savings targets with icons, priority, deadline, currency
- **goal_contributions** - Deposit/withdraw tracking with transaction links
- **recurring_transactions** - Scheduled automation (daily/weekly/monthly/yearly)
- **password_resets** - Token-based password recovery
- **invitations** - Email invites for family groups

### API Endpoints Structure
- `/api/auth/*` - Login, register, OAuth, logout
